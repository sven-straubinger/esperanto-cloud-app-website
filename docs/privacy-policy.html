      <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
      <h4>Firebase</h4>
      <p>We use Firebase as third party subprocessor to provide the technical infrastructure and the Service of the App. Firebase is a platform developed by Google LLC (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California, U.S.) for creating modern web applications. It is used for hosting, data storage and communication via HTTPS. The App acts as a broker between your store and Shopify services. In general, Firebase monitors info- &amp; error-events occurring in the App and/or backend services, and collects data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, and date/time stamps. Following Firebase Services are used by us to provide the Service:
      <ul>
        <li>Cloud Firestore</li>
        <li>Cloud Functions for Firebase</li>
      </ul>
      Please see the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms" target="_blank">Terms of Service for Firebase Services</a> for more information on how data is processed.
      </p>
      <p>Compliance with the GDPR is a top priority for Google. Google takes a customer-centric approach on protection, control, and compliance:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy and Security in Firebase</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/data-processing-terms" target="_blank">Firebase Data Processing and Security Terms</a></li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <h4>DeepL</h4>
      <p>We use DeepL API as third party subprocessor to provide automated translations for a subset of languages. DeepL is a platform developed by DeepL SE (Maarweg 165, 50825 Köln, Germany) for creating machine translations. Texts or documents you submit will not be permanently stored and will only be kept temporarily to the extent necessary for the production and transmission of the translation. After complete performance of the contractually agreed services all submitted texts or documents and their translations will be deleted. Your texts will not be used to improve the quality of the DeepL services.</p>
      <p>For further information on the processing of your data within DeepL (DeepL Pro subscription), please refer to section 5 of the <a href="https://www.deepl.com/en/privacy" target="_blank">DeepL privacy policy</a> and the <a href="https://www.deepl.com/en/pro-license/" target="_blank">DeepL Pro Terms and Conditions.</a></p>
